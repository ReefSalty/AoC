# Advent of Code [Year] Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [Year] event. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow a story.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl. It consists of a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and can be solved in any programming language you like.

## My Approach

In this section, describe your approach to solving the puzzles. You can talk about the programming language you used, any specific algorithms or data structures that were particularly helpful, or any other insights you gained.

## Structure of This Repository

- `Day01`: Folder containing solutions for Day 1.
  - `part1.py`: Solution for Part 1 of Day 1.
  - `part2.py`: Solution for Part 2 of Day 1.
- `Day02`: Folder containing solutions for Day 2.
  - ... and so on for each day.

## Running the Solutions

Provide instructions on how to run your solutions. Include any prerequisites, such as installing a specific programming language or libraries.

Example:
```bash
python Day01/part1.py
